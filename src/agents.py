"""Proposer agents and the language-model plug-in seam.

The search loop depends only on the :class:`Proposer` protocol. Two real
implementations are provided:

* :class:`DeterministicProposer` — a rule-based policy used for the
  reproducible exemplar runs, tests, and the rendered figures. No mocks: it is
  a genuine proposer that reads the shared state and emits a concrete proposal.
* :class:`HermesProposer` — the live AutoScientists agent (implemented in
  ``scripts/hermes_proposer.py`` so ``src/`` stays infrastructure-free).

Swapping ``DeterministicProposer`` for ``HermesProposer`` is the only change
needed to turn the deterministic reference run into a live agentic one.
